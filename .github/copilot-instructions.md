This is a small Bevy-based 2D sprite based game. The game is still in early development.
It uses classic 2D sprite sheets for character animations. It uses an 8 directional isometric style. This means each character has 8 directions Ã— multiple states, each with its own sprite sheet.
Keep instructions short and actionable: follow existing patterns in `src/` and asset layout under `assets/`.
